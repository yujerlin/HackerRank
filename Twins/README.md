# Twins #

### Problem ###

Lia is fascinated by anything she considers to be a twin. She calls a pairs of positive integers, i and j, twins if:

- They are both prime. A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

- Their absolute difference is exactly equal to 2.

Given an inclusive interval of integers from n to m, can you help Lia find the number of pairs of twins there are in the interval (i.e., [n, m])? Note that pairs (i,j) and (j,i) are considered to be the same pair.

### Sample Input ###
```
3 13
```
### Sample Output ###
```
3
```
 ### Explanation  ###

There are three pairs of twins:(3,5), (5,7), and (11,13).
