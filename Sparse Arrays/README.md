# Sparse Arrays #

### Problem ###

There are N strings. Each string's length is no more than 20 characters. There are also Q queries. For each query, you are given a string, and you need to find out how many times this string occurred previously.

### Sample Input ###
```
4
aba
baba
aba
xzxb
3
aba
xzxb
ab
```
### Sample Output ###
```
2
1
0
```
 ### Explanation  ###

Here, "aba" occurs twice, in the first and third string. The string "xzxb" occurs once in the fourth string, and "ab" does not occur at all.
